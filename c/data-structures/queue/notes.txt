Queue is a FIFO structure, first in first out;
Queue is a Single Linked List

Example: A(head) -> B -> C -> D(tail) -- We want to insert E here
  D must point to E and update our tail to point to E;
  tail.next = E
  tail = E;

Pop A: Head points to B, return A
  head = head.next
  return h.value (A)
